The beginning
Hello Fellow Members from all over the world! Since this is the new beginning for me I'm excited and really hope all works out good.  I want to stay postive while I'm taking this new ride.  Life is short, I am aware of that. I feel like I have wasted so much of my time and still sometime feel like I have all the time in the world.  What is my purpose? Why am I here? Are still some of the questions I often think about. I want to be a strong runner through this journey until those questions are fully answered and satsifed.
